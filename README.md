# Tic-Tac-Toe, Player vs Computer<br />
C++ <br />
This program was built in Visual Studio 2017. This program will not run in another version of Visual Studio<br />
You will need to install glut-3.7.6-bin.zip on to your system<br />

I built this program during my Computer Science 2 class.<br />
I wanted to test out my coding ability, so I decided to create something simple.<br />
This Tic-Tac-Toe uses glut to display images to a window.<br />
